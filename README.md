Hello, my name is Hongxi Li. I am pursuing my Master’s degree in the Media Computing and Intelligent Systems Laboratory (MCISLab) at the School of Computer, Beijing Institute of Technology, under the supervision of [Prof. Xinxiao Wu](https://wuxinxiao.github.io/). My research scope includes visual understanding and video summarization, and I am also enthusiastic about participating in other interesting projects related to deep learning or pre-trained models.
